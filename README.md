# DiseaseBasket

This program (which should be named disease-basket) implements the Apriori algorithm to
find out which symptoms go together for particular diseases. It reads in data from .csv files which
are tabularized rows of 1's and 0's and generates strings of the symptoms which go together for a
particular level of 'strictness'.

I included three disease samples. They're the three CSV files out there. If anything is unclear, please contact me.
